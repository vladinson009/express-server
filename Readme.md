# Game Store API

This is an Express.js server application implementing a backend API for a Game Store platform. It manages users, games, categories, platforms, and cards (user-generated content), using MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence.

---

## Features

- User authentication and role management (`user`, `admin`, `moderator`)
- CRUD operations for games, categories, platforms, and cards
- Support for likes on games and cards by users
- Soft-delete functionality for users with automatic expiration (TTL)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

---

## Project Structure

- **Models:** Defines Mongoose schemas and models for the entities in the system.
- **Controllers:** Handle API logic (not shown here).
- **Routes:** API endpoints (not shown here).
